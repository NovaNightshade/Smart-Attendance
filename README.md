# Smart-Attendance

This is the project we did during the time we were doing the internship in IIT Kanpur as a team. Purpose of the project was to allow easy registration and provide a smart and quick way to monitor attendance of each individual in a class. If we think about the future scope of it, the project could be used for official parties, conferences, events, public events, etc. to allow identifying the presence of individuals using any mid-quality camera.

In the iSMRITI Internship, we secured second position for this project. Considering the fact that all age groups attended that internship, and over 50 teams were present, it was a big achievement for us.
